## üìÇ Projects

### 1. Biker Sales Performance Analysis | Excel

-Organized and structured raw data by creating a separate working worksheet.

-Cleaned and transformed over 1,000 sales records to prepare for analysis, ensuring data accuracy and usability.

-Developed three PivotTables to analyze:

       1. Average income per purchase by gender
   
       2. Number of bikes purchased by commute distance
   
       3. Number of bikes purchased by age group
   
-Designed an interactive Excel dashboard incorporating the PivotTables, with slicers to dynamically filter results by marital status, region, and education level.

Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, pivot table analysis, interactive dashboards, data visualization, trend analysis

### 3. World Layoffs Data Exploration | SQL

I performed data exploration using SQL to understand the structure and trends in the global layoffs dataset. This involved writing multiple queries to analyze the distribution of layoffs across time, industries, companies, and countries.

Key steps in the data exploration process included:

-Created a separate table from the raw dataset to work with a cleaner version for analysis.

-Calculated the total number of layoffs using GROUP BY and ORDER BY with DESC to rank companies by total layoffs in descending order.

-Aggregated total layoffs by industry using SUM(total_laid_off) along with GROUP BY and ORDER BY to identify the most impacted sectors.

-Conducted country-level analysis by grouping data by country to compare the regional impact of layoffs.

-Explored layoffs over time by calculating yearly totals, generating rolling monthly totals, and identifying the top 5 companies with the highest number of layoffs each year using ranking techniques.

These SQL-based exploratory queries revealed that layoffs peaked in 2022 and 2023, with the tech industry and the United States being the most significantly affected.

### 4. AIRBNB Analysis | Tableau

In this project, I designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze Airbnb listings data with the goal of helping users understand market trends, pricing strategies, and availability patterns across different regions.

The dataset included information such as listing price, location (latitude/longitude), room type, number of reviews, availability, and host details. I performed data preparation in Excel and Tableau Prep to clean and structure the data.

Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard that included the following key visualizations:

-A map view displaying the average listing price by ZIP code, enabling users to identify geographic pricing patterns.

-Price analysis charts comparing average nightly rates based on the number of bedrooms, helping to highlight how pricing scales with property size.

-A descending bar chart showing the average price per ZIP code, allowing for quick identification of the highest- and lowest-priced areas.

-A line graph illustrating revenue growth trends throughout the year 2016, offering insights into seasonality and market performance over time.

The dashboard provided actionable insights for both Airbnb hosts (to optimize pricing and availability) and travelers (to identify good-value listings in high-demand areas).


### 5. Data Proffession Survey | Microsoft Power BI

The objective of this analysis was to derive actionable insights into the demographics, skill sets, compensation, tools, and job satisfaction of professionals working in data-related roles, including Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Business Intelligence Developers.

This interactive Power BI dashboard presents key findings from the survey, offering a comprehensive view of the data profession landscape. The dashboard includes the following insights:

-Respondent Distribution: Number of survey participants by country and job role.

-Demographics: Average age of respondents by country and profession.

-Work-Life Balance: Perceived work-life balance across countries and job roles.

-Salary Satisfaction: Levels of satisfaction with compensation by region and profession.

-Industry Accessibility: Perceived difficulty in breaking into data-related roles by country and profession.

-Compensation Trends: Average salaries segmented by job title and geographic region.

-Preferred Programming Languages: Top languages used, broken down by profession.

This dashboard allows users to explore global trends, benchmark roles and salaries, and uncover gaps in skills or compensation across different regions and professions within the data industry.
